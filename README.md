## 📝 Description

ScholarMap is a web application designed to help students and learners from around the world find and access scholarships, fellowships, and free online courses. As someone who has personally struggled to find reliable and up-to-date information about educational opportunities, I created this platform to solve a real-life problem. Many students waste time browsing multiple websites, only to find outdated or incomplete scholarship information. ScholarMap aims to centralize this information and display it in an organized and user-friendly way.

The project is built using Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It’s simple, responsive, and can be extended in the future. The opportunities are displayed in order of expiration date, and each opportunity has a dedicated detail page with full information.
